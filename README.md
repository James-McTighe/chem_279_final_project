# chem_279_final_project

## Instructions (Rough Draft WIP)

1. build image with bash build_image.sh
2. run interactive session with bash interactive.sh
3. Compile program with bash build.sh inside container
4. Run executable with ./build/ir_spec MolJSON/H2.json (or alternative input mol.xyz file) 

5. Outputs are printed to terminal and saved in HDF5 format in the output directory.

Next steps:
1. Implement Geomertry optimization code (HW1) - Steepest descent.
2. Start test suite for code accuracy and installation sanity checks.
